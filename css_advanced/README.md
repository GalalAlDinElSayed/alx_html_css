# CSS Advanced Project

This project is part of the HTML advanced concept course. It focuses on the CSS styling and layout of a webpage.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to practice advanced CSS concepts and styles to create a responsive and visually appealing webpage.

### Steps to Complete the Project:

1. **Responsive Web Design**: 
   - Use CSS Flexbox for layout.
   - Ensure the page adapts well to different screen sizes (desktop and mobile).

2. **Styling**:
   - Add colors, borders, background images, and other styling elements.
   - Customize the layout and typography based on the Figma design.

3. **HTML Markup**:
   - Write HTML code based on the Figma design and provided structure.
   - Implement all necessary HTML elements including `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and more.
   - Use images, logos, and other assets as required.

4. **Fonts**:
   - The design uses custom fonts: 
     - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
     - [Spin Cycle OT](https://www.dafont.com/spin-cycle.font)

   Ensure these fonts are imported and applied correctly.

5. **Figma Design**:
   - You can access the design file [here](insert-figma-link).
   - If you're unable to view the design, download it and duplicate it to your drafts.

### File Structure
